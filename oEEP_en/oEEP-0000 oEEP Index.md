## oEEP Types

- D (Document): Documents containing consolidated information. This oEEP type includes community indexes, guidelines, specifications, or other information related to openEuler.
- P (Process): Processes for the openEuler community include requirements related to community governance, CI/CD, testing, and more.
- S (Standard): Standards are design changes to openEuler's code, tools, and configurations that result in feature changes visible to developers, system administrators, and users.

## oEEP Statuses

- I (Initial): Currently active draft, but the information contained has not yet reached a consensus.
- A (Accepted): Accepted by the Technical Committee (TC) and the implementer and in the process of implementation (for the P and S types).
- A (Active): Actively maintained and valid information (for the D type).
- D (Deactive): Inactive but may be reactivated later.
- F (Final): Completed and requires no further follow-up operation (for the P and S types).
- P (Provision): Basic consensus has been reached, pending formal decision by the TC.
- R (Rejected): Officially rejected by the TC.
- S (Substituted): Superseded by a subsequent oEEP.
- W (Withdrawn): Withdrawn by the proposer.
