## Motivation and Objectives

As of July 10, 2023, openEuler has 427 innovation project repositories. However, these open source projects demonstrate varying levels of progress.
We need a mechanism to identify innovation projects valuable to openEuler and prioritize community promotion resources towards them.

To effectively identify valuable innovation projects while maintaining fairness and transparency, this document outlines the evaluation criteria, awards, and selection process for excellent projects.

## openEuler Excellent Project Evaluation Criteria

- Open Source and Openness  
  This is a prerequisite. Participating projects must be open source, adopt an open source license recognized by the community, and be open to all community developers.

- Industry impact  
  Projects should be widely recognized and used within the industry, with evidence provided through feedback from the User Committee and industry customers.

- Technology innovation  
  Projects should be acknowledged by technical experts for employing new industry technologies or filling industry gaps. Maintaining existing projects is not considered innovative.

- Community activity  
  Projects should be recognized by community developers, demonstrate active community development, and involve a diverse range of contributors.

- High-quality development and operations  
  Repositories should adhere to code specifications, with high-quality code and documentation. Pull request (PR) submissions should be comprehensive, code review processes complete, and review aspects and content detailed. User feedback should be addressed promptly.
  
## openEuler Excellent Project Awards

- Comprehensive awards:
    - openEuler Excellent Projects of the Year: awarded to the most excellent open source projects of the year, with the primary development repositories hosted in openEuler. The recommended number of awards is no more than five.
    - openEuler New Projects of the Year: awarded to the best open source projects established in openEuler within the year. The recommended number of awards is no more than five.

- Individual awards:
    - openEuler Gold Project Repositories of the Year: The recommended number of awards is no more than three.
    - openEuler Impactful Projects of the Year: The recommended number of awards is no more than three.
    - openEuler Innovative Projects of the Year: The recommended number of awards is no more than three.
    - openEuler Active Projects of the Year: The recommended number of awards is no more than three.

## openEuler Excellent Project Selection Process

1. The Technical Committee (TC) initiates the review process and accepts recommendations from the entire community. (September)
2. The TC conducts an initial review and announces a shortlist of projects. (October)
3. The User Committee scores and ranks shortlisted projects based on industry impacts. (Before the end of October)
4. The TC scores and ranks shortlisted projects based on technology innovation. (Before the end of October)
5. The TC publishes the shortlisted projects on the openEuler community forum to gather community feedback and votes. (Before the end of October)
6. The TC discusses and determines the final list of awarded projects. (Early November)
7. The excellent projects are announced at the openEuler Summit and featured as key content in the openEuler White Papers of the following year.
